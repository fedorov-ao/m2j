Running under Linux

(# means running command in shell as root, $ - as regular user)

Dependencies: python evdev module and uinput.
Maybe need to
#modprobe -i uinput

Install evdev module
$pip install evdev

Note: evdev-1.6.0 for python 2.7 is bugged and will not run. Copy device.py and uinput.py files from evdev dir to ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/evdev/ (~ is home dir).
$cp evdev/{device,uinput}.py ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/evdev/

m2j_linux.py uses /dev/uinput , which typically belongs to user root and group root.
In order to be able to run emulator without sudo following steps are needed:

* add group "input" (can be any other appropriate name)
#groupadd input

* change the group of /dev/uinput to "input"
#chown root:input /dev/uinput

* change group permissions of "/dev/uinput" to "rw"
$chmod g+rw /dev/uinput

* add the user to the group "input"
#usermod -a -G input axf

* reboot

* check
$ls -l /dev/uinput
